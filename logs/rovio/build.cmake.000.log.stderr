CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:15 (add_subdirectory):
  The source directory

    /home/ubuntu/coding/ethz_asl_UAV_autonomous/src/rovio/lightweight_filtering

  does not contain a CMakeLists.txt file.

  CMake does not support this case but it used to work accidentally and is
  being allowed for compatibility.

  Policy CMP0014 is not set: Input directories must have CMakeLists.txt.  Run
  "cmake --help-policy CMP0014" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
